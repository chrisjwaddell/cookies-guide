# Cookies Guide

This is an interactive <i>Cookies Guide</i> that helps you understand how cookies work. There is an Express server file that you can run and as you go through this <i>Cookies Guide</i> you can click a button on these pages that run fetch commands and see cookies being added to the browser and look at the console <i>Network</i> tab.

### To get started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run the Express server file by typing in <i>npm run server.
3. If you use a web server Extension (eg Live Server) within VS Code, it's already configured to port 8055, if instead, you use a different web server, please use port 25051.
4. Open a web browser and go to <i>http://127.0.0.1:8055/client/01-basic-cookie-1.html</i>
