#Cookies Guide

This is an interactive <i>Cookies Guide</i> that helps you understand how cookies work. There is an Express server file that you can run and as you go through this <i>Cookies Guide</i> you can run fetch commands and see cookies being added and look at cookies being added in the browser and look at the console <i>Network</i> tab.

Please run the Express server file by typing in <i>npm run server</i> in a console.
If you use a web server within VS Code, it's already configured to port 25051, if instead, you use a different web server, please use port 25051.
