                    <h1>Uses and Advantages Cookies have</h1>

                    <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol. This is the reason cookies were added to browsers, to provide more
                        personalized network connections. Cookies give the ability to remember and improve. They make
                        interaction with the website better.</p>
                    <p>Cookies have two unique traits that make them very desirable:<br>&#x2022 They are passed
                        automatically on each request to server.<br>&#x2022 Lifetime of cookies is more precise and
                        natural for session management.</p>
                    <p>Some of the main uses of cookies are:<br>&#x2022 Session management and authentication<br>&#x2022
                        Personalizing<br>&#x2022 User tracking</p>

                    <h2>Session management</h2>
                    <p>One of the main uses of cookies is to keep a user logged in even when they close all windows on
                        the website so they don't have to keep logging in every time they visit the site. </p>
                    <p>Cookies are also very applicable for online shopping and remembering shopping cart selections. If
                        the user searches the site for cowboy boots, then the next time the user comes to the site, the
                        website will retrieve the user's record and fill the landing page with more cowboy boots.
                        Ecommerce sites use a combination of session cookies and persistent cookies to create a seamless
                        shopping cart experience. As the user adds items to her cart, session cookies keep track of the
                        items. If the user abandons the cart, persistent cookies will retrieve her selections from the
                        database the next time she visits. She will see her items already in the cart and ready to
                        purchase. This is a huge help in encouraging conversions.</p>
                    <h2>Personalizing</h2>
                    <p>Cookies can be used for personalising a userâ€™s browsing experience and storing user preferences.
                        They can make the user experience more personal eg "Welcome back Mary".</p>
                    <h2>Tracking</h2>
                    <p>If you are only using cookies to keep a user logged in or for storing personal preference data,
                        you don't need to ask for permission to store cookies. If however, you are using cookies to
                        track users, you need to ask for permission to store cookies. </p>
                    <p>Third-party cookies can be used to track users. A webpage might load an ad banner (lets say
                        <i>ads.com</i>). In the request for the ad banner, since it is requesting from <i>ads.com</i>,
                        the browser sends cookies that have <i>domain</i> set as <i>ads.com</i> which match the
                        requested domain and in the response back from ads.com, as well as sending the banner image, it
                        also sends cookies back to store in the browser. When you view other websites, if these websites
                        have an ad banner also belonging to <i>ads.com</i>, they can build a history of your viewing
                        habits. Based on the cookies they are receiving back from your browser, they can create a
                        profile of a user's browsing history and habits.</p>
                    <p>This is a contentious issue and many people are against anything stored about them. Some people
                        don't allow cookies to be collected on their device.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 80px;">Advantages of cookies</h3>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Cookies are sent to the browser without you having to do anything</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 They can be secured with flags (same origin, HTTP-only, HTTPS etc)</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 HTTP-Only cookies can't be compromised with XSS attacks</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 They are well secured on the client side because of SSL</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 They've lasted since 1994</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Javascript can't access cookies (if HttpOnly)</p>


                    <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Disadvantages of cookies</h3>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web
                        application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over. Say a Web page contains four
                        images, an external CSS document and a JavaScript document. Set a 4K cookie on that domain and
                        the browser transfers that cookie to the server once for the HTML page, once for each image,
                        once for the CSS document and once for the JavaScript document.</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Server must store each user session in memory</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Storage limit is smallest at 4kb</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 The larger the cookie, the larger each request</p>
                    <p class="m-0">&#x2022 Cookies save all values in one long string and has to be parsed every time
                        you need to retrieve a value, localStorage is easy key/value pair</p>


                    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Cookies are used differently thesedays because now we have other
                        storage options - Local Storage & Session Storage & IndexedDB. Their use as a place to store
                        data is being replaced by localStorage and other things now.</p>
